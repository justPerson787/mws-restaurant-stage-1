## About Project

This project has been created as a part of the Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree. The starter code of a static webpage has been provided by Udacity.
I converted the design to be responsive and added some accessibility for screen reader users. Also, I added a service worker to provide some offline experience for users.

For Python 2.x, use python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
For Python 3.x, use python -m http.server 8000
